Assignment 3 for CSE3320 OS

This assignment was to create a program called "mavalloc" which replicates the functionality of malloc, but implements it using a linked list instead of the heap. 5 benchmark programs were created to test the efficiency of the program, and a report was written on the results of these benchmarks.
